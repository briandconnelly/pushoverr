#' Check whether an emergency priority message was received

#' \code{check_receipt} checks the status of an emergency priority message,
#' receiving information about whether and by whom it was acknowledged,
#' when the message was last delivered, whether a callback URL was visited,
#' and more.

#' @param receipt receipt ID from sending an emergency message
#' @param app application token (see \code{\link{set_pushover_app}})
#'
#' @return a list containing the following fields:
#' \itemize{
#'     \item \code{status}: request status (1 = success)
#'     \item \code{acknowledged}: number indicating whether (\code{1}) or not (\code{0}) notification has been acknowledged

#'     \item \code{last_delivered_at}: Unix timestamp of when the notification was last acknowledged, or 0
#'     \item \code{expired}: whether (\code{1}) or not (\code{0}) the notification has expired
