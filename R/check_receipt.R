#' Check whether an emergency priority message was received
#'
#' `check_receipt()` checks the status of an emergency priority message,
#' receiving information about whether and by whom it was acknowledged,
#' when the message was last delivered, whether a callback URL was visited,
#' and more.
#'
#' @param receipt receipt ID from sending an emergency message
#' @param app application token (see [`set_pushover_app()`])
#'
#' @return a list containing the following fields:
#' \itemize{
#'     \item `status`: request status (`1` = success)
#'     \item `acknowledged`: number indicating whether (`1`) or not (`0`) notification has been acknowledged
#'     \item `acknowledged_at`: Unix timestamp indicating when notification was acknowledged, or 0
#'     \item `acknowledged_by`: key of the user who first acknowledged the notification, or `""`
#'     \item `acknowledged_by_device`: name of the device on which the first user acknowledged the notification
#'     \item `last_delivered_at`: Unix timestamp of when the notification was last acknowledged, or `0`
#'     \item `expired`: whether (`1`) or not (`0`) the notification has expired
#'     \item `expires_at`: Unix timestamp indicating when the notification will no longer be retried
#'     \item `called_back`: whether (`1`) or not (`0`) the callback URL has been visited
#'     \item `called_back_at`: Unix timestamp indicating when the callback URL was visited
#'     \item `request`: unique request ID
#'     \item `errors`: a list of error messages (only for unsuccessful requests)
#'     \item `raw`: the raw [httr::response] object
