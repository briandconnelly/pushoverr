# pushoverr

Got some R code that takes a while to complete? Enough time to take a little
walk or go get a coffee, but not long enough to go home for the day?  pushoverr
is an R package that allows you to send push notifications via
[Pushover](https://pushover.net/) to your iOS or Android devices. Now you'll be
able to let yourself know when it's done.

## Prerequisites

You'll need a free account with [Pushover](https://pushover.net/). Once you
have that, log in and [register an
application](https://pushover.net/apps/build). You'll get two codes---a **user
key** and an **API token/key**. These are what identify you and your apps to
Pushover. You'll pass these along in pushoverr whenever you send a message.
