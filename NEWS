# pushoverr 0.1.2

* Fixed small issue with user/token storage, which allowed similarly named variables outside the namespace to be used
* pushover_* helper functions now return invisible values. Request tokens can still be saved to a variable, but will not be printed when the functions are not part of an assignment operation. The return values of `pushover_high` are visible.
