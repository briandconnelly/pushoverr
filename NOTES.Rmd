# TODO
* Function to check receipt status of a Message (https://pushover.net/api#receipt)
    * https://api.pushover.net/1/receipts/(your receipt).json?token=(your app token)
    * Function that takes a receipt code and builds a response
        * Helper function that checks the that response
* PushoverResponse should have a query slot that stores the original query.
    * Or the query url at least
* PushoverResponse should have a content slot that stores the content from the query (has some useful information)
* Methods to set user and API keys. These will remain in the session (in the right namespace). If none provided when object created, it can check these vars
    * http://www.r-bloggers.com/package-wide-variablescache-in-r-packages/
* Make a vignette

# Alternatives
* http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/notifyR/index.html - unmaintained, not very nicely implemented
