# TODO
* PushoverResponse should have a query slot that stores the original query.
* Methods to set user and API keys. These will remain in the session (in the right namespace). If none provided when object created, it can check these vars
    * http://www.r-bloggers.com/package-wide-variablescache-in-r-packages/
* functions in Response for app limits, etc?

# Alternatives
* http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/notifyR/index.html - unmaintained, not very nicely implemented
